## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+ must be installed
- pip package manager

### Setup Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

```

### Alternative: Direct Installation
If you prefer not to use a virtual environment:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data Setup
Add your data file to the `uploads/` folder or upload via the admin panel.

## Usage

**Option 1 - Command line with specific file:**
```sh
python scripts/run_batch_new.py uploads/your_data_file.xlsx
```

**Option 2 - Use last uploaded file:**
```sh
python scripts/run_batch_new.py
```
(Reads from `uploads/last_uploaded.json` automatically)

### Output Locations:
- `app/static/plots/` ‚Üí Product analysis and forecast charts (PNG)
- `app/static/reports/` ‚Üí Model forecasts (CSV), comprehensive PDF report, sheet summary
- Project root ‚Üí `future_forecast.csv` (legacy compatibility)
